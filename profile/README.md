## Change is Key!

Change is Key! is a research program in which we aim to create computational tools to turn text into a story of both our language, our societies and culture and how these have changed over time.

Firstly, we will develop corpus-based methods for detecting semantic change (over time) and variation (across social groups and media types). This will create general tools for the study and detection of language change at large-scale and directly benefit historical linguistics and lexicography. Secondly, in collaboration with researchers from each field, we aim to answer research questions in social sciences, gender studies, and literary studies.

The program spans six years (2022 - 2027) with a total of 11 researchers, one research engineer and six partner universities.

We are co-organizing the third International Workshop on Computational Approaches to Historical Language Change 2022 ([LChange'22](https://languagechange.org/events/2022-acl-lchange/)) that will be held end of May 2022 in Dublin. Come join us!

This research program is funded by the [Riksbankens Jubileumsfond](https://www.rj.se/en/grants/2021/change-is-key-the-study-of-contemporary-and-historical-societies-using-methods-for-synchronic-semantic-variation-and-diachronic-semantic-change/) under reference number M21-0021 for a total of 33.5 Million SEK.
